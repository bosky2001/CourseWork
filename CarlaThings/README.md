# Part1: Introduction to Self-Driving Cars

Welcome to Introduction to Self-Driving Cars, the first course in University of Torontoâ€™s Self-Driving Cars Specialization. This course will introduce you to the terminology, design considerations and safety assessment of self-driving cars. By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand commonly used hardware used for self-driving cars - Identify the main components of the self-driving software stack - Program vehicle modelling and control 
- Analyze the safety frameworks and current industry practices for vehicle development 

For the final project in this course, I had to develop control code to navigate a self-driving car around a racetrack in the CARLA simulation environment.I constructed longitudinal dynamic model and PID controller for longitudinal control tracking. Also constrcuted the lateral dynamic model and developed a Pure pursuit, Stanley and MPC controller for lateral control tracking.
