## TBH67H450 Motor Driver

1. The module has two direction control pins for each channel
    1. The IN1 and IN2 pins control the spinning direction of the motor
1. The spinning direction of a motor can be controlled by applying either a logic HIGH(5 Volts) or logic LOW(Ground) to these inputs
1. `IN1` and `IN2` are also used to turn the motors ON, OFF and control its speed
    1. Pulling pin high will make motor spin
    1. Pulling pin low will make motor stop
1. `OUT1` and `OUT2` are connected to the motor 
1. [Datasheet](https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/info/TB67H450FNG_datasheet_en_20201126.pdf?did=65346&prodName=TB67H450FNG)

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Direction |
|--|--|--|
| Low(0) | Low(0) | Motor OFF 	|
| High(1) | Low(0) | Forward 	|
| Low(0) | High(1) | Backward 	|
